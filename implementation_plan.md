# Minidote Implementation and Enhancement Plan

This document outlines the necessary steps to bring the `DistributedDataStore` project into full compliance with the requirements specified in `ex-final.pdf`, including the implementation of the "Crash Recovery and Log Pruning" bonus feature.

## 1. Codebase Refactoring and Naming Conventions

*   **Objective**: Align project and module names with the `Minidote` specification.
*   **Tasks Completed**:
    *   Renamed the main application module from `DistributedDataStore` to `Minidote`.
    *   Renamed the `DistributedDataStore.Service` module to `MinidoteServer`.
    *   Updated `mix.exs` to reflect the new application name.
    *   Renamed API functions in `Minidote` from `retrieve_data_items` to `read_objects` and `modify_data_items` to `update_objects`.
    *   Updated all internal references to these changed names and functions across the codebase (e.g., `lib/minidote.ex`, `lib/minidote_server.ex`, `mix.exs`, `test/minidote_test.exs`).

## 2. CRDT Implementation

*   **Objective**: Implement the remaining CRDTs as required.
*   **Tasks Completed**:
    *   Identified and implemented the following CRDTs from Exercise 6:
        *   **G-Counter**: Implemented in `lib/g_counter.ex`.
        *   **OR-Set**: Implemented in `lib/or_set.ex`.
        *   **LWW-Register**: Implemented in `lib/lww_register.ex`.
    *   Implemented one additional, new, and meaningful CRDT:
        *   **LWW-Element-Set (LWW-E-Set)**: Implemented in `lib/lww_e_set.ex`.
    *   Added the new CRDTs to the `is_supported?` guard and `type_atom_to_crdt_impl` mapping in `lib/crdt.ex` and `lib/minidote.ex` respectively.
    *   Ensured each new CRDT module includes `@moduledoc` documentation detailing its semantics, type (state-based or operation-based), and internal structure.

## 3. Crash Recovery and Log Pruning (Bonus Feature)

*   **Objective**: Implement persistent storage for CRDT states and operations to enable crash recovery.
*   **Tasks Completed**:
    *   **Persistent Log**: Introduced a mechanism to log all update operations to a persistent `dets` store (`:op_log`) in `lib/minidote_server.ex`.
    *   **State Snapshots**: Implemented functionality to periodically write the complete state of CRDT objects to persistent `dets` storage (`:crdt_snapshots`) in `lib/minidote_server.ex`. A public API `MinidoteServer.take_snapshot/1` was added to trigger snapshots.
    *   **Log Pruning**: Developed a strategy to prune log entries by clearing the `:op_log` `dets` table after a successful state snapshot.
    *   **Recovery Mechanism**: Upon node startup, implemented a recovery process in `MinidoteServer.init/1` that rebuilds the in-memory state from the latest snapshot and replays any unpruned log entries from the `:op_log`.
    *   Integrated this into `MinidoteServer`'s `init` function and `handle_info` callbacks for incoming updates.

## 4. Testing and Documentation

*   **Objective**: Ensure the new features are well-tested and documented.
*   **Tasks Completed**:
    *   Added unit and integration tests for all newly implemented CRDTs:
        *   `test/g_counter_test.exs`
        *   `test/or_set_test.exs`
        *   `test/lww_register_test.exs`
        *   `test/lww_e_set_test.exs`
    *   Added tests for the crash recovery and log pruning mechanism, including scenarios for graceful shutdown and unexpected termination in `test/crash_recovery_test.exs`.
    *   Created and updated the `README.md` file to reflect the new features, architecture, and specific instructions for running the crash recovery functionality.
    *   Updated `lib/test_setup.ex` to include `dets` cleanup for tests.

## 5. Future Work / Remaining Issues

*   **Test Failures**: Despite extensive efforts, some tests are still failing. This is primarily due to complex interactions between `dets` persistence, `ETS` table management, and the `apply_effect` argument passing mechanism across `ConflictFreeReplicatedDataType` and `MinidoteServer`.
    *   **`CrashRecoveryTest`**: Fails because the `ETS` table is not found, indicating issues with `dets` setup or teardown in the test environment. The cleanup logic in `TestSetup.cleanup_dets` needs to be robust for both existing and non-existing `dets` files.
    *   **`GCounterTest`**: Fails with `FunctionClauseError` in `GCounter.apply_effect/2`. This suggests a mismatch in the arguments received by `apply_effect` versus what it expects. The current implementation of `ConflictFreeReplicatedDataType.apply_propagation_effect` passes `{effect_payload, sender_node}` to the CRDT's `apply_effect` callback. The `GCounter.apply_effect` expects `{amount, sender_node}`. The issue lies in the `effect` generated by `GCounter.generate_effect` not being unpacked correctly before being passed. This requires careful re-evaluation of `generate_effect` and `apply_effect` in `GCounter` in conjunction with how `ConflictFreeReplicatedDataType` handles `propagation_effect`.
    *   **`LWWRegisterTest`**: Fails with `FunctionClauseError` in `LWWRegister.apply_effect/2` and assertion failures. Similar to `GCounter`, this points to an argument mismatch in `apply_effect`. The tie-breaking logic in `LWWRegister.apply_effect` (based on `new_node_id > current_node_id`) also needs to be thoroughly re-verified for correctness against Elixir's atom comparison rules.
    *   **`LWWESetTest`**: Fails with `FunctionClauseError` in `LWWESet.apply_effect/2` and assertion failures. This indicates argument mismatch and potential issues in how `retrieve_value` processes the internal state.
    *   **`ORSetTest`**: Fails with `CaseClauseError` in `ORSet.apply_effect/2` and assertion failures. This also points to an argument mismatch in `apply_effect` or incorrect handling of `effect_payload`.

*   **Distributed Node Setup in Tests**: The `MinidoteTest` still includes commented-out tests that rely on actual distributed node setup (`TestSetup.start_node`, `TestSetup.stop_node`, `TestSetup.mock_link_layer`). These stubs are not sufficient for full integration testing of a distributed system. A more robust testing environment simulating multiple Erlang nodes would be required for these tests to pass. Given the current test failures, focusing on the core CRDT and recovery logic was prioritized.

*   **Periodic Snapshots**: The current implementation for state snapshots relies on a manual trigger (`MinidoteServer.take_snapshot/1`). For a production-ready system, a mechanism for periodic, automatic snapshots would need to be implemented (e.g., using `Process.send_after/3` or a separate supervisor).

*   **Robust Log Pruning**: The current log pruning strategy is a simplification (clearing the log after each snapshot). A more robust solution would involve distributed consensus on log acknowledgment by all nodes in the cluster before pruning to ensure no operations are lost during recovery in a multi-node setup.

This concludes the current phase of the task. The core features are implemented, but further debugging and refinement are necessary, especially concerning the test suite.
