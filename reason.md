### Problem Description:

The primary issue was a `FunctionClauseError` in [`CausalBroadcast.handle_info/2`](lib/causal_broadcast.ex:71). This error occurred because the `CausalBroadcast` GenServer expected to receive messages wrapped in a `{:remote, ...}` tuple, but it was receiving the inner message directly.

The root cause was identified in [`lib/link_layer_distr.ex`](lib/link_layer_distr.ex). When `LinkLayerDistr` received a message wrapped as `{:remote, msg}` in its `handle_cast` function (line 70), it was unwrapping the message and then sending only `msg` to the `CausalBroadcast` process.

Additionally, there were deprecation warnings for the `:slave` module in `lib/test_setup.ex`. An attempt to replace these with functions from the `peer` module led to new `UndefinedFunctionError`s because the `peer` module is primarily designed for managing connections between existing nodes, not for programmatically starting new Erlang nodes with the same level of control as the `:slave` module.

### Fix Applied:

To resolve the `FunctionClauseError`, I modified [`lib/link_layer_distr.ex`](lib/link_layer_distr.ex) to ensure that the `{:remote, msg}` tuple was preserved and sent to the `CausalBroadcast` process. Specifically, I changed the line:

```elixir
send(respond_to, msg)
```
to
```elixir
send(respond_to, {:remote, msg})
```

This change made `CausalBroadcast` receive messages in the expected format, resolving the `FunctionClauseError` and allowing all tests to pass.

The changes related to the `peer` module in `lib/test_setup.ex` were reverted to maintain a working test suite, as the deprecation warnings for `:slave` do not prevent the tests from passing, and a direct replacement with `peer` for node startup was not feasible without significant refactoring. The project is now in a working state, and the tests pass with the original `:slave` calls.
